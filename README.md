DSP_Spectrum_Analyzer
=====================

DSP Spectrum Analyzer Miami Dade College Final Project using 8 FIR filters

This software is free to use by any party interested.

Project was implemented on a Beagleboard xM module.

Filters were created using MatLab at various center frequencies.

Screen graphics created using N-Curses for visual effect.

Since FIR filters were used the analyzer is a little slow to respond.
